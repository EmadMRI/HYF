				<p>Bassel Khartabil, the Syrian open source <strong>developer</strong>, blogger, entrepreneur, hackerspace founder, and free culture advocate, has been executed by the Syrian authorities. Noura Ghazi Safadi, his wife, received confirmation of her husband's death by the Assad-led Syrian government yesterday. The execution took place in secret in November 2015. It has taken the Syrian government nearly two years to officially communicate that fact to his friends and family.</p>
				<p>Bassel had been imprisoned by the Syrian authorities since his abduction from the streets of Damascus on March 15, 2012. He was originally taken, interrogated and tortured in secret in a facility controlled by the country's General Intelligence Directorate. After a worldwide campaign by international human rights groups, together with Bassel's many colleagues in the open Internet and free culture communities, he was moved to Adra's civilian prison, from where he was able to communicate with his family and friends. </p> 
				<p>Multiple governments condemned Syria's holding of Bassel, and the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared Bassel's imprisonment unlawful in April 2015, but the Assad government refused to release him or provide any information on his case to the outside world.</p>

				 	Of my experience spending three years in jail so far for writing open source code (mainly), I can tell you how much authoritarian regimes feel the dangers of technology on their continuity. And they should be afraid of that, as code is much more than tools. It's an education that opens youthful minds, and moves nations forward. Who can stop that? No-one... I'm in jail, but still have thousands if not millions of my hands and minds outside writing code and hacking and they will always keep doing that, no matter what stupid actions these regimes take to stop the motion.<strong> As long as you people out there are doing what you are doing, my soul is free. Jail is only a temporary physical limitation."</strong>

				  	As he predicted, Bassel's imprisonment did not stop the cultural work he pioneered. Instead, his example motivated the growth of a global community of coders and activists. Bassel's supporters preserved and expanded the projects he loved in his name. They contributed articles on Syria to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> on his behalf, translated open source projects like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank"> 
				  	<strong>Mozilla's browser</strong> </a> into more languages, broadened the Creative Commons through book-writing sprints, and scrambled to preserve, in data, the architectural jewels of Palmyra, documented by Bassel, that were destroyed in Syria's subsequent civil war.

					Noura, his wife, and his friends Jon Phillips, Barry Threw and Dana Trometer, worked tirelessly to promote his cause, and inspiring many others with his story and their dedication to his freedom. Over the five years since his abduction, hundreds of free culture activists that never met Bassel, like artist and filmmaker Niki Korth, and anthropologist Barbara Ruehling, were drawn by his case to contribute to his community and his mission.

					We at EFF are heartbroken at the news of Bassel's unjust and unlawful killing. The single consolation is that Bassel, before and after his detention, inspired so many to join the cause he cared so much about. Until his very last days, his wife and friends ensured he knew that, sharing that precious knowledge with Bassel, just as he had shared his knowledge with the world. He always knew he was loved and not forgotten: and that, filled with that certainty, even in his last days, Bassel indeed knew that his soul was free.
